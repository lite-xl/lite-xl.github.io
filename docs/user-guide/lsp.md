description: Learn how to configure Language Servers to support Intellisense in Lite XL.
---

Many text editors support "Intellisense" (error reporting, smart autocompletion, formatting, linting)
out-of-the-box with a language server client.
[Language Server Protocol] is a protocol developed by Microsoft to facilitate creating tooling that 
are separate from editors â€” unlike in a traditional IDE where tooling is directly integrated into the editor.

Lite XL does not provide a language server client, but the functionality is available via the [LSP] plugin.
In this article, we will discuss how to properly set up language servers for use with the plugin.

To find out if your favourite language of choice is fully supported on Lite XL, take a look at the
[Language Support Status][pb-ide-language-support-status] page.

If you're interested in helping us add or improve support for more languages, take a look at the following pages:

- [Utilities][pb-ide-utilities]
- [Build Integration][pb-ide-build]
- [Debug Integration][pb-ide-debug]

## Installation

The LSP plugin can be installed like any other Lite XL plugins.

The LSP plugin depends on the [widget] and optionally [lint+] and [lsp_snippets] plugin for rendering UI elements.
When installing the plugin manually, you must also install these plugins as well.

=== "lpm"

    To install a plugin with lpm via the command line, run:
    ```sh
    $ lpm plugin install lsp
    ```

=== "Miq"

    To install LSP via Miq, add `lite-xl/lite-xl-lsp` into your `config.plugins.miq.plugins`:

    ```lua
    local config = require "core.config"
    config.plugins.miq.plugins = {
    -- this allows Miq to manage itself
    'TorchedSammy/Miq',

    -- install lsp
    'lite-xl/lite-xl-lsp',
    }
    ```

    Afterwards, run the command `miq:install` to begin installation.

=== "Manual Installation"

    To install the LSP plugin manually, run these commands:

    ```sh
    $ cd ~/.config/lite-xl/
    $ git clone https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl-lsp plugins/lsp
    $ git clone https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl-widgets libraries/widget
    $ git clone https://github.com/liquidev/lintplus plugins/lintplus
    $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vqns/lite-xl-snippets/main/snippets.lua \
        -O plugins/snippets.lua
    $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vqns/lite-xl-snippets/main/lsp_snippets.lua \
        -O plugins/lsp_snippets.lua
    ```

    They install the plugin with all its dependencies.

## Installing Language Servers

The LSP plugin requires languages servers to be installed on the system to function.
Some editors such as [Visual Studio Code] and [Neovim] tends to have this process abstracted by plugins.
Luckily, Lite XL provides commonly-used language servers as plugins as well, prefixed with `lsp_`.

| Plugin            | Language(s)         | Server          | Platforms
| ------            | -----------         | ------          | ---------
| [lsp_c]           | C, C++, Objective-C | [clangd]        | Linux, macOS, Windows
| [lsp_lua]         | Lua                 | [LuaLS]         | Linux, macOS, Windows
| [lsp_python]      | Python              | [Pyright]       | Linux, macOS, Windows
| [lsp_quicklintjs] | JavaScript          | [quick-lint-js] | Linux, macOS, Windows
| [lsp_rust]        | Rust                | [rust-analyzer] | Linux, macOS, Windows
| [lsp_tex]         | TeX                 | [texlab]        | Linux, macOS, Windows
| [lsp_zig]         | Zig                 | [zls]           | Linux, macOS, Windows

### Manual Installation

The LSP plugin expects language servers to be accessible in `PATH`.
If you have installed the language server from package managers such as `npm` and `pip`,
please ensure that **their local installation directory is in `PATH`**.

!!! important
    Even more care needs to be given to those who uses a node.js version manager such as [nvm],
    as the npm prefix changes when switching node.js versions.
    You should always **launch Lite XL after sourcing nvm**
    (do this for any Lite XL's desktop entries as well).

## Set Up

!!! note "If you installed the language servers via plugins, then you should skip this step."

The LSP plugin provides default configuration for most language servers, based on [nvim-lspconfig].
These configurations are available by requiring `plugins.lsp.config` in your user module.
For example, to configure [typescript-language-server], you can do:

```lua
local lspconfig = require "plugins.lsp.config"

-- set up typescript-language-server with default configuration (enough for most people)
lspconfig.tsserver.setup()

-- override the default configuration
lspconfig.tsserver.setup {
    verbose = false
}
```

## Features

After configuring your language server, you should see a log message in the form of
`[LSP] starting (language server name)` followed by `[(language server name)] Initialized`
when opening a file supported by the language server.
These messages indicate that the language server is properly set up and is running for the document.

### Enhanced Autocomplete

One of the most prominent features of a language server is to provide autocomplete suggestions.
The LSP plugin integrates with the [autocomplete] plugin to provide this functionality.

![lsp-autocomplete]{ loading=lazy }

### Snippets

When installed with [lsp_snippets], the LSP plugin is able to provide snippets from language servers.
The snippets are also integrated with the [autocomplete] plugin.

![lsp-snippets]{ loading=lazy }

### Inline Diagnostics

When installed with [lint+], the LSP plugin will show diagnostics on the affected lines.
You can disable this with `lsp:toggle-diagnostics` (++shift+alt+e++).

![lsp-inline-diagnostics]{ loading=lazy }

### Symbol Search

To view all symbols in a file, you can use `lsp:view-document-symbols` (++alt+s++).
You can use `lsp:find-workspace-symbol` (++shift+alt+s++) to find a symbol in the current workspace.

![lsp-view-symbol]{ loading=lazy }
![lsp-search-symbol]{ loading=lazy }

### Tooltips

You can hover on symbols to check their types and descriptions.

![lsp-hover]{ loading=lazy }

Tooltips will also appear when entering function arguments.

![lsp-args]{ loading=lazy }

### Go to Definition

Press ++alt+d++ to jump to definition.

![lsp-goto-definition]{ loading=lazy }

### Find References

Press ++alt+f++ to find references to a symbol.

![lsp-find-references]{ loading=lazy }

### Document Formatting

Press ++alt+shift+f++ to format the current document.

![lsp-format]{ loading=lazy }

### Diagnostics

Press ++alt+e++ to view diagnostics messages for the current document.
Press ++ctrl+alt+e++ to view diagnostics messages for the workspace.

![lsp-view-doc-diagnostics]{ loading=lazy }
![lsp-view-all-diagnostics]{ loading=lazy }

## Troubleshooting

We are constantly updating the LSP plugin to fix bugs, add features and improve performance.
If you encounter any issues, you should **always update to the latest version** before trying other steps.

### Enable Debug Logging

If you encounter an error message such as `[LSP] (language server name) was shutdown, revise your configuration`,
you should try to enable debug logging to see what is happening when the language server is run.

This is very useful on Windows as the plugin runs the language server with `cmd.exe`
(to work around wrappers like those provided by npm) and this can cause errors to never propagate back
to the plugin.

=== "User Module"

    In your user module, add:

    ```lua
    config.plugins.lsp.log_server_stderr = true
    ```

=== "Settings GUI"

    Navigate to the "Plugins" tab.
    Under the "Language Server Protocol" section, enable "Log Standard Error".

    ![lsp-debug-logging]{ loading=lazy }

### Language Servers not starting

There are many reasons why a language server will not launch, the most common being the plugin cannot find
the language server in `PATH`.

On Windows, this often manifests as 
`(language server name) is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.`.
The LSP plugin uses `cmd.exe` on Windows to launch the language server in order to work around
different file extensions such as `.cmd`, `.bat` and `.exe`.

To solve this issue, make sure that the language server is on `PATH`.
For non-native language servers (e.g. typescript-language-server), make sure their installation path
with respect to the package managers are on `PATH` as well.
For npm, this is usually `AppData\Roaming\npm` on Windows.

### jdt.ls launches Microsoft Store

If you've installed [jdt.ls] from their website, you might run into issues where Microsoft Store is launched
instead of running the language server properly.

jdt.ls seems to expect users to have Python installed, and Windows has app execution aliases built in to
redirect `python.exe` and `python3.exe` to Microsoft Store.

![win-execution-alias]{ loading=lazy }

To fix this, install [Python].
Alternatively, you can follow the [instructions from jdt.ls][jdtls-cmdline] to run the language server
without Python at all.
